Shared score-computation service.

This module provides two categories of output:

1. **Factual cycle statistics** (average / shortest / longest cycle length,
   average bleeding duration) computed directly from CycleLog history with
   no model inference.  These are the primary stats surfaced to clients
   since Issue #300.

2. Legacy CVI/MHS scores (kept internally for the provider dashboard which
   still depends on them).  They are *not* exposed through /dashboard or
   /scores any longer.

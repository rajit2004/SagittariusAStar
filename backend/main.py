# ── Middleware ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# outermost. RequestContextMiddleware is added first so CORSMiddleware wraps
# it — CORS preflight (OPTIONS) is then answered without generating an access
# log line, while every real request still gets an id before any handler runs.
app.add_middleware(RequestContextMiddleware)

# Security headers sit between the two (#405): inside CORS, so a preflight is
# still answered by CORSMiddleware without being decorated — the browser reads
# a preflight response itself and never renders it — and outside the request
# context middleware, so the headers land on the error envelope too. Every
# response, including a 500, passes through here.

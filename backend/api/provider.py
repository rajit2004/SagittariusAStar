"""Provider dashboard endpoints (issue #267).

Healthcare professionals register and log in through their own flow, then
see only the patients who have explicitly granted them consent. Consent
grant/list/revoke live on this router too: they are the patient side of
the same feature, and keeping the new surface in one place makes the
consent contract (and its tests) easy to follow.

Issue #346: this router's own account flow originally predated both the
password policy (#330) and the named rate-limit policies (#329), and had
picked up neither. It hashed whatever password it was given — a single
character was accepted — and metered login with an inline call carrying
its own magic numbers, while registration was not metered at all.

The rule this module now follows is that a provider account is held to
*at least* the standard a patient account is held to, never a lower one.
That is not symmetry for its own sake: this is the account that reads
other people's cycle logs once they consent, so the weaker of the two
doors is the one worth closing first. Everything below is imported from
the same modules ``core/auth_router.py`` uses, rather than reimplemented,
so the two flows cannot drift apart again.

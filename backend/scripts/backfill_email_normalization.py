"""Canonicalise the ``email`` field on existing user documents (issue #380).

Everything written since #380 is stored lower-cased. Documents created
*before* it kept whatever capitalisation the local part was typed with —
``EmailStr`` had already folded the domain, so the drift is in the local
part only, e.g. ``Sana@example.com``.

``UserService.get_user_by_email`` copes with those rows by falling back to
a second, byte-exact query on the string the caller supplied. That is
enough for a user who types her address the way she originally did, and it
is deliberately not a collection scan. It is not a fix, though — it is a
compatibility shim, and it costs one extra read on every failed lookup.

Running this once removes the need for it. After a clean run every
``email`` in ``users`` is canonical, the fallback in
``get_user_by_email`` becomes dead weight, and it can be deleted.

Two things this refuses to do quietly:

**It will not merge duplicates.** If ``Sana@example.com`` and
``sana@example.com`` are both present, they are two accounts with two
cycle histories, and deciding which one survives is not a script's call —
one of them may be the one she has been logging into for months. Those are
reported and skipped, and the exit status is non-zero so a deploy pipeline
notices.

**It writes nothing without ``--apply``.** The default is a dry run that
prints exactly what would change.

Run from the ``backend`` directory:

    python scripts/backfill_email_normalization.py            # dry run
    python scripts/backfill_email_normalization.py --apply    # write

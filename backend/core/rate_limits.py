"""Named rate-limit policies for the API's unauthenticated entry points.

Before this module the only rate-limited auth route was
``POST /auth/firebase-login``, which called ``RateLimitService`` inline with
magic numbers. Every other route in ``core/auth_router.py`` — including the
email/password login the web app actually uses — accepted unlimited attempts.

The pieces here are deliberately small:

``RateLimitPolicy``
    A named bucket with its own limit and window, both overridable from the
    environment so a deployment can tighten them without a code change (the
    same pattern ``ASSISTANT_RATE_LIMIT`` / ``ASSISTANT_RATE_WINDOW``
    already use). One policy per *thing being protected*, not one global
    number: a password guess and a password-reset email have very different
    costs, and giving them a shared budget means whichever is noisier
    starves the other.

``enforce`` / ``clear``
    The only two operations a route needs. ``enforce`` raises the 429 —
    routes never build that response themselves, so ``Retry-After`` cannot
    be forgotten on one route and present on another.

Identifiers are hashed before they reach Firestore. A key like
``login_account:sana@example.com`` would put a plaintext email address in a
document id, in a collection nothing else treats as personal data, retained
for as long as the document lives. The hash is as usable as a bucket key and
carries none of that.

Which address a request counts against is decided in ``core.client_address``
rather than here. That used to be four lines at the bottom of this module
reading ``X-Forwarded-For``, which made the bucket key something the caller
could choose — see #498 and the docstring there.
